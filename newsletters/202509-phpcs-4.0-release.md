# PRESS RELEASE

## Highlights of the 4.0 release

* Root rulesets can now overrule config and CLI settings set in child rulesets.
* Ability to scan files without extension.
* Less chance on scans failing on parse errors during live coding.
* Exit code improvements
* Proper separation of output between STDOUT and STDERR.
    Piping output to STDOUT will no longer contain progress information or error notices
* Array properties set in a ruleset file can now extend a potential default value for the property.


Other note worthy improvements from the past few months
* Permalinks to XSD schema
* The documentation Wiki is now publicly editable.


<!-- MAYBE, but probably not appropriate for the release mail, maybe better to move this to the "2 year after take-over" mail Dec 1st -->
We'd also like to commemorate Robbert MÃ¼ller, co-maintainer of the PHP_CodeSniffer Composer Installer plugin, who passed away at the age of 46 this July.
