# About This Directory

The automation for the PHP_CodeSniffer wiki allows for running `phpcs`/`phpcbf` commands to generate output examples for the documentation using the `build/wiki-command-replacer.sh` script.

Sometimes a command will need some code to run `phpcs`/`phpcbf` over to obtain the output to display in the wiki.

The code samples needed for this, should be placed in this directory.
